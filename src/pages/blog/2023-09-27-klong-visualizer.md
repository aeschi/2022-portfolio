On behalf of [KLING KLANG KLONG ↗](https://www.klingklangklong.com/), a Berlin sound studio,  [Simon Stimberg ↗](http://simonstimberg.de/) and I conceptualized and developed an audiovisualization tool tailored for their music and sound environments. The sound brings the visual matter to life and thus transmits impulses for movement to the individual particles. Without sound, the particles are very inert and hardly active. As soon as the sound is playing different parameters influence their movement behavior. Constant analysis of the audio file creates permanent new visual patterns formed by a multitude of particles.[ Resulting visualizations ↗](https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ9XvVqrPtY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
