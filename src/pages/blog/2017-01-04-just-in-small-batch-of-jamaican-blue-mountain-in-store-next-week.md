description: '"rongin shagor - the multicolored ocean" symbolizes the variety of
  poetic and artistic interpretations and inspirations that emerge from a poem.
  They drift, embark, collide, and stay afloat - all in the same place, each
  marking the beginnings of different struggles in identity politics. Dreams,
  visions and associative imagination of poetry are reinforced by a collective
  growth of individual, sequential works of art - beginning with the
  aforementioned poem by May Ayim. The reactions of interdisciplinary artists to
  this work have shaped “rongin shagor” and invite others to participate.'
