What is the first impression when you leave the house? [T]RÄUME DEINEN KIEZ FREI questions our definition of public space, especially the way we perceive it, what we encounter in public space and what is our dream version of it. The website presents data from an online workshop and interviews.\
\
During the workshop, participants were able to share their subjective perspective on their immediate living environment in Berlin, both in terms of the status quo, as well as for their dreams and visions. The data generation was done by individual entries of the participants on an online map as well as written notes during group discussions.\
\
The project was part of the [Mapping Cities - Making Cities Seminar ↗](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/mapping/) held by [Professor Marian Dörk ↗](https://mariandoerk.de/) at FH Potsdam and developed by Kalen Harris, Leonie Schatter, Oskar Schmieg, Jonas Harant and me. We executed the workshop in cooperation with [Changing Cities e.V. ↗](https://changing-cities.org/). I was in charge of the web development and datavis design.
