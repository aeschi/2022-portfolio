The climate crisis is an anxiety-provoking topic for future generations. These visualizations explore the intersection between privilege and climate anxiety, showing how people from the Gloabal South are heavily affected by climate anxiety. The last slide compares the expenditure on heating and electricity per person in the EU countries vs. the global average.

T﻿he graphics were part of a data journalism workshop by [Francesca Morini ↗](https://www.morini.design/) on how to bring data visualizations about inequality in the climate crisis to Instagram. I﻿ collaborated with [Johanna Hartmann ↗](https://johannahartmann.de/) and Lutricia Valentine. They were later [posted by taz ↗](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYgGdsvIk8G/) on their social media account.
