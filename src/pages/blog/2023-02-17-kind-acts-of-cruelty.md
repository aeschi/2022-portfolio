  A microaggression is a comment or gesture (whether made intentionally or not)
  that feeds into stereotypes or negative assumptions created around oppressed
  or marginalized groups of people.


  Our installation is surrounding the viewer, creating an immersive spatial experience with the use of projection mapping. Our main metaphor about microaggressions is that they are like mosquito-bites, one is an inconvenient feeling, but it’s easy to get over it, but as they happen more and more often, and the quantity and the frequency increases, they become unbearable.
