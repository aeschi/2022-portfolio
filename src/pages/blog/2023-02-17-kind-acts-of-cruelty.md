Remnants - Kind Acts of Cruelty was an installation and accompanying website about microaggressions. The visitors were surrounded by a swarm of letters constantly grouping into phrases and bursting into a swarm again. Our main metaphor about microaggressions is that they are like mosquito-bites, one is an inconvenient feeling, but it’s easy to get over it, but as they happen more and more often, and the quantity and the frequency increases, they become unbearable.\

Further information about the topic is on our website [kindactsofcruelty.com ↗](https://kindactsofcruelty.com/). Here is the [teaser film ↗](https://vimeo.com/509402966) for the installation. The installation was exhibited at 48h Neukölln at KINDL and at Sehsüchte Festival.\

The project was a collaboration with Rita Eperjesi, Jacky Lai, Zainab Tariq, Denise Bischof, and Ellina Nurmukhametova. With the support of Klara Otto, Júlia Koffler, Félix Römer, Florian Kempf, and Marie Scharnagl.
