The immersive documentary tells the story of a woman's experience with sexual harassment. It is about cases of everyday harassment that are often labeled as unpleasant but ultimately harmless incidents. These stories are narrated by her while the viewer is surrounded by her animated and shadowy memories through a VR headset. T﻿he memories were captured with LIDAR and volumetric video.\

I﻿ mostly worked on creating the memories in unity together with Zainab Tariq and the director Vincent Abert.
