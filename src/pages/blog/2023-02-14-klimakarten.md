  In collaboration with the newspaper taz, we designed and produced both
  physical and digital postcards containing visualizations covering various
  aspects of climate protection and mitigation in Germany. For each of the 401
  districts and 16 states in Germany, the reader can explore climate protection
  postcards in the five sectors: energy, mobility, buildings, agriculture, and
  waste. The goal of our research is to study readers’ engagement with data
  visualizations on the topic of climate protection — across multiple media
  channels. 


  This work was in collaboration with Francesca Morini, Johanna Hartmann, Marian Dörk and taz journalists.
