In collaboration with the newspaper taz , we designed and produced both physical and digital postcards containing visualizations covering various aspects of climate protection and mitigation in Germany.
For each of the 401 districts and 16 states in Germany, the reader can explore climate protection postcards in the five sectors: energy, mobility, buildings, agriculture, and waste. The goal of our research is to study readers’ engagement with data visualizations on the topic of climate protection — across multiple media channels.\
