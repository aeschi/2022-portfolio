Where does the Water flow is an installation on Berlins’ Water Infrastructure. It is composed of several info panels narrating through relevant topics: water consumption, ground water levels, challenges to the water cycle, and structural as well as individual solutions. The info panels are supported by data physicalizations exploring the predicted occurrence of extreme weather scenarios in Berlin.
